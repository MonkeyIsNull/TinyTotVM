# TinyTotVM 🍼💻

> There are many virtual machines, but this one is mine.

**TinyTotVM** is a tiny, stack-based virtual machine written in Rust. It’s not the fastest, or the smartest, or even the most useful — but it's *yours to build*. Think of it as a starter set for writing your own programming language, one stack frame at a time.
